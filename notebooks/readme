ML process
1. Load and shuffle the cat and dog image dataset.
2. Preprocessing of images (color, RGB, grayscale, resize,	Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Prewitt Edge Detection, Morphological Edge Detection)
3. EDA dropping wrong images, getting the shape of elements and features.
4. splitting dataset training 80% -test20%
5. StandarScaler
6. Best PCA
7. Best SVC
8. Best RF
9. Best KNN
10. Evaluating the model performance 10-fold cross-validation.
11. Assembler models (Gradient Boosting, Bagging, Majority voting)



BOVW models incldue train and validate.

Val_2 works for updates inference

fastai resnet train and evaluate models are available with unshared (because too large) resnet50 models
